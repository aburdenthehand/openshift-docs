= About liveness and readiness probes

When a virtual machineInstance (VMI) fails, _liveness probes_ stop the VMI.
Controllers such as virtual machine then spawn other VMIs, restoring virtual
machine responsiveness.

_Readiness probes_ tell services and endpoints that the virtual machineInstance
is ready to receive traffic from services. If readiness probes fail,
the virtual machineInstance is removed from
applicable endpoints until the probe recovers.
