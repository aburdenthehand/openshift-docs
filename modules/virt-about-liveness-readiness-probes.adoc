= About liveness and readiness probes

When a virtual machine instance (VMI) fails, _liveness probes_ stop the VMI.
Controllers such as virtual machine then spawn other VMIs, restoring virtual machine responsiveness.

_Readiness probes_ tell services and endpoints that the virtual machine instance
is ready to receive traffic from services. If readiness probes fail, the virtual machine instance is removed from applicable endpoints until the probe recovers.
